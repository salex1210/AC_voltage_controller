# SINGLE-PHASE AC VOLTAGE CONTROLLER

A voltage controller for alternating current (AC) is a converter that regulates the voltage, current, and average power supplied to an AC load from an AC source. It uses electronic switches that connect and disconnect the source and the load at regular intervals. In the phase control scheme, switching occurs in each cycle of the source, removing part of the waveform before it reaches the load. Another control method is integral cycle control, where the source is connected and disconnected for several cycles at a time.

This project addresses the design of an AC control to supply 5KW of power to a series R-L load, using a 220V AC supply voltage. The results obtained are expected to contribute to advancements in the design and development of AC control systems in the industrial field.

This project provides a solid knowledge base on the key components and concepts related to the design and simulation of a line AC control.
